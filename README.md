## Retro Rampage

### About

Retro Rampage is a tutorial series in which you will learn how to build a Wolfenstein-like game from scratch, in Swift. Initially the game will be targeting iPhone and iPad, but the engine should work on any platform that can run Swift code.

Modern shooters have moved on a bit from Wolfenstein's grid-based 2.5D world, but we're going to stick with that template for a few reasons:

* It's feasible to build Wolfenstein's 3D engine from scratch, without a lot of complicated math and without needing to know anything about GPUs or shaders.

* It's simple to create and visualize maps that are constructed on a 2D grid, avoiding the complexities of 3D modeling and animation tools.

* Tile grids are an excellent way to prototype techniques such as procedural map generation, pathfinding and line-of-sight calculations, which can then be applied to more complex worlds.

### Goal

At this moment this project is following to the Lockwood tutorial which is a really great engineer and programmer. He is really doing a great job and thank you Lockwood for your great contribution.
My main goal from this project is to learn as many as possible from Lockwood and then take this project and refactor iOS-Platform-layer, create tools for other platforms and make this game on different platforms like Mac,Linux,Windows.
Add options feature, AI, difficulty and many other funny thing.
